# Better Inventory

## Features
Item context menu (right click) additons:
- ``Salvage``: This is functionally equivalent to putting the item into the crafting menu and attempting to "craft" it. 
The result is usually iron scraps, linen, palladium, etc.
- ``Send to Stash``: Sends the item to your stash. This option works only if you are in a town with an active stash (so either a free one or you own a house there).
- ``Send to Host's Stash``: Sends the item to the host's stash (ie. the player whose world you are in). This option works only if you are not the host in a multiplayer session.
- ``Send to [Player name]``: Sends the item to the other player. This option works only if you are in multiplayer and have one or more co-op partners connected.

## Configuration
It is strongly recommended to use [Outward Config Manager](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/Mefino/Outward_Config_Manager/).
- **Salvage**: Enables or disables the Salvage action.
- **Send to Stash**: Enables or disables the Send to Stash action.
- **Send to Host Stash**: Enables or disables the Send to Host's Stash action.
- **Send to Other Player**: Enables or disables the Send to Other Player action.
- **Send to Other Player max distance**: Sets the maximum distance for the Send to Other Player action (in metres). Default is 10.

## Planned features:
- Drag and drop items and skills onto quickslots to assign
- Skill menu filters (offensive, sigils, boons, mana spells, stamina skills, etc)
- Custom skill menu filters (based on user specified criteria)
- Optional: Button to cast all spells in a category (useful for boons, probably better with custom filters)
- Localization
- Some more salvage recipes (bows for example)
- Filter items and skills by name
- Compatibility with any mods that add or change stashes
- Notification for the target player when someone sends them an item (instead of just silently adding it to their inventory)

## What to do when the mod doesn't work as intended?
There is a slight chance that the mod may break (and break your game) in various exciting ways.
If anything untoward happens (or nothing happens, which is also a problem), please do **one** of the following:
- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Faeryn/OutwardBetterInventory/issues/new)
- Report it to me on the [Outward Modding Community](https://discord.gg/zKyfGmy7TR) Discord

I'd love if you also attached a list of mods you are using, and the log from `Outward\Outward_Defed\output_log.txt`.
