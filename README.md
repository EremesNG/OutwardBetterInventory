# Better Inventory

## Features
Adds the following features to the inventory menu:
- 'Salvage' option in the item context menu (right click)


Planned features:
- Drag and drop items and skills onto quickslots to assign
- Skill menu filters (offensive, sigils, boons, mana spells, stamina skills, etc)
- Custom skill menu filters (based on user specified criteria)
- Optional: Button to cast all spells in a category (useful for boons, probably better with custom filters)
- Optional: Send item to nearby stash (only when in house or in town with house)
- Optional: Send item to co-op partner
- Localization
- Better icon

There is a high chance that I will put the optional (read: potentially "cheaty") improvements into another mod.
